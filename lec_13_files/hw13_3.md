# Why wouldn't the approach work for arrays?

Because we can't assume product of U and V is default constructible. So in the std::array case, we have to allocate the space during initialization of about-to-be-returned 2-d array, which will fail if product type is not default constructible.

# How would you make it work?

Thus I will have to make the non-default-constructible product type to be initilized in the std::array.
Instead of doing
    std::array<T,N> ret{};
I have to copy/move construct like
    std::array<T,N> ret{Tv, Tv, Tv, ... , Tv};
and Tv will be picked from the product of first element of the two vectors. (v1[0] * v2[0])

then I got the implementation from this post
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18497122/how-to-initialize-stdarrayt-n-elegantly-if-t-is-not-default-constructible

basically using the 'repeat' function to unfold the above construction automatically.
