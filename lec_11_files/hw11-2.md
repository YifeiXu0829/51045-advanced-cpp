# How does it resemble C++23's std::expected?
they use the same idea, which is using two return types, one represents the desired result, and the other represents the unpexted exception.

# How does it differ? # Where they differ, which do you like better and why?
main difference, and my thoughts:
    1. From Outcome class, return types result/error are not from a std::variant but two seperate variables. I feel them not illustrative since only one can be present at a time. I'd like a std::variant better in this case.

    2. There is NO unexpected wrapper of E for outcome class, what if R and E has the same type? constructor will have ambiguity thus causing a compiling error, which I dislike in this case.

    3. there are 3 move constructors with convertible type for Outcome class. It does provide some flexibility for various use cases but I could feel ambiguity here since as a user I should only move construct when both return types can be convertible repectively (the first move constructor from Outcome class), the rest two (only one return type is convertible) could cause bugs potentially.

    4. no swap implementation for Outcome class, but Expected class swap has too many restrictions(enable_if_t) to use, I don't feel like it's useful anyway.


    5. Could add some operater overloading for Outcome class (bool(), \*()) for ease of usage but it does provide explicit calls like IsSuccess(), GetResult(), GetError().
