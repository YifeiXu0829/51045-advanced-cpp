# Do you think it is an improvement? Why ?

The main thing I have changed is to use c++17 'from_chars' to replace old 'stoi' when convert a string into an integerand I believe it is necessary improvement there. For old 'stoi' if no conversion could be performed, an invalid_argument exception will be eagerly thrown, which is not what we want. What we want is from_chars which can handle exceptions locally and return to us to decide if a conversion can't be performed (lazily thrown).
