# Can it be improved with different memory orderings ? Why or why not?
My answer is no.
reasons:
1. since multiple threads can be hashed into a same bucket, we do need protection from data racing thus memory_order_relaxed is out of picture.
2. the operation `counts[index].count++` is where the atomic protects and by default using memory_order_seq_cst to guarantee sequential consistency. The operation does the following two steps

    auto old = count.load();
    count.store(old+1);

but in one atomically step. I don't think memory_order_acquire/memory_order_release pairs can be used here since two steps break atomicity and creates data race.
