# What is your opinion of this approach?

performancethis approach gets rid of runtime polymorphism dispatch overhead, results in better performance. However at compile time every possible branches has been considered into compilation so compile time will be longer.

# Do the SOLID principles shed any light on that?

yes, solid principles should still be applied by static polyorphism, which better fortifies the relations between base and derived classes. The only change is using complie time method dispatching rather than runtime to boost performance.
